# Matchr

Matchr is an experimental user friendly color picker.  
It is beforehand the first personal project I have ever created to help me learn the basics of webdev / webdesign.

It is built on a basic HTML5, CSS3, Javascrip, jQuery stack.  
(A massive recoding will be due soon, introducing the use of React)

### TODOS
* Include React
* Follow SMCSS approach
